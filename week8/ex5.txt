Physical addresses are hardware memory addresses.
Virtual addresses are the addresses of the virtual storage used by the processor.

Virtual addresses may be the same as physical addresses or different. In the case of a difference, the memory management unit (MMU) maps the virtual addresses to the physical addresses.
